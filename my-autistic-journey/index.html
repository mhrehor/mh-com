I have been thinking about this, and researching it, for several years at least now. The easiest way for me to start off will be with linking to this <a href="https://roryreckons.blog/2021/02/23/what-happens-if-youre-masking-and-you-dont-realise/">blog post</a> by Rory Reckons on Autistic burnout. This, by far, is the best explanation of what happened, is happening, to me since about my late 30’s to now. It is so close to what happened, how I was, am, feeling that I could have written it myself.</p><p>My journey into the possibility of Autism began while I was researching my rare disease periodic paralysis (PP), and all the possibly accompanying comorbid conditions. That lead me into getting whole genome sequencing (WGS) done to try and find the causative gene for my rare disease, and any other possible things that may be causing other symptoms. I saw a few genes come up talking about autism, but didn’t really think much about it because I always saw the stereotypes in the media and thought that isn’t me. One that came up in the results, that matched a lot of my symptoms, was Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and another was mitochondrial (mito) disorder. In the support groups for my periodic paralysis I saw many talking about their hypermobility and EDS, and a few times I heard people talk about the possibility of mitochondrial disorders being primary or secondary causes of PP. So I joined some EDS and mito support groups and just started listening, because that is what I do and I want to make sure I listen a lot, make sure that it really is something that is related to me, and not something I am just wanting to be related to me. I think this is because I have been disbelieved so much in the medical community, plus I really don’t want to get it wrong because I don’t want to treat something I don’t have because I have been given treatments that have caused me so much harm I really need to get it right.</p><p>Anyways, I started hearing about people in the EDS and mito groups talking about autism more often and a possible link with autistic people having these health problems. They began sharing articles about autism and I started to see more people talking about being #ActuallyAutistic online. I began listening to what they had to say, reading the resources they shared, and realizing that this may explain who I am, and why I am the way I am. The header image explains the process I pretty much went through mentally in coming to the realization I am autistic. During this process I took several online tests, including many I don’t share here, showing that I am likely autistic, just another piece cementing for me that I am autistic. </p></div></div></div></div><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_2"><div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child"><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light"><div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="align-left">Another thing that I started realizing when looking into being autistic is the other things autistic people sometimes have too. Like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD), demand avoidance, etc. Just like with autism I had these media influenced images of things like OCD and I thought that couldn’t be me, then I started listening to people who have it, and I realized it wasn’t really anything like that for most people and that I likely have it. So after listening and learning more again, I found a couple more tests to see if there was a possibility, and again found more that I have as well. I also have ADHD, OCD, RSD, and demand avoidance.</p><div class="et_pb_section et_pb_section_1 et_section_regular"><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_2"><div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child"><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_text_align_justified et_pb_bg_layout_light"><div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="msg msg--warning align-left"><em>I am avoiding the terminology PDA, or pathological demand avoidance, because it is very controversial and I believe demand avoidance describes it accurately for me.</em></p><hr><h2 class="align-center">Testing</h2><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://drive.google.com/embeddedfolderview?id=14picGgyrBAY8B2qD_Uiiphr50Mfa0rLb#list" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><hr><h2 class="align-center">Co-Occuring Diagnosis</h2><h4 class="align-center">Official Diagnosis</h4><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><em>* Rare Disease | # Genetic Link</em></span></p><ul><li>Anxiety</li><li>Bradycardia</li><li>Depression</li><li>Double Vision</li><li>Hypermobility</li><li>Insomnia</li><li>Mild Cognitive Disorder</li><li>Mollaret’s Meningitis (Recurrent Viral Meningitis)*</li><li>Periodic Paralysis*</li><li>PTSD</li><li>Spinal Stenosis</li><li>Traumatic Brain Injuries</li></ul><h4 class="align-center">Self (SD) &amp; Suspected (SUS) Diagnosis</h4><ul><li class="align-left">ADHD (SD)</li><li class="align-left">Andersen-Tawil Syndrome*# (SUS)</li><li class="align-left">Autism# (SD)</li><li class="align-left">Dysautonomia (SD)</li><li class="align-left">Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome or Connective Tissue Disorder (SUS)#</li><li class="align-left">Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SUS)#</li><li class="align-left">Leigh Syndrome*# (SUS)</li><li class="align-left">Mast Cell Disorder (SUS)</li><li class="align-left">Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency# (SUS)</li><li class="align-left">OCD (SD)</li><li class="align-left">Paramyotonia Congenita*# (SUS) </li><li class="align-left">Spinal Instability (SUS)</li></ul><hr><h2 class="align-center">Associated Autism Characteristics</h2><ul><li>Hyperacusis</li><li>Misophonia</li><li>Tinnitus</li><li>Hyposensitivity</li><li>Skin sensitivity</li><li>Hyperempathy</li><li>Mirror-touch synaesthesia</li><li>Auditory Processing Disorder</li></ul><h2 class="align-center">Other Supporting Evidence</h2><ul><li>Strong empathetic connection to animals</li><li>Regularly told to stop making sounds with my mouth or body</li><li>Have meltdowns when get too stressed including self harm</li><li>Need to rock or sway to sooth at times</li><li>Was bullied at school, but some other kids stood up for me</li><li>Only had a couple close friends as a child and and adult</li><li>Substance abuse problems in my twenties</li><li>Struggled through school and only got some college done due to stress</li><li>Testing in high school showed very smart, but poor grades</li><li>Adverse reactions to SSRI’s</li><li>Reduced anxiety due to not having to interact in social situations during pandemic</li><li>Autistic mirroring (especially accents)</li></ul><hr><h2 class="align-center">Things That Helped Me</h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p class="align-center" dir="ltr" lang="en">🎭The Masked Autistic Quiz🎭</p>If you’ve spent your life ‘faking normal, you might not look autistic to the casual observer.
